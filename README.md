â”œâ”€â”€ components/        # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cart/          # Cart-related components + unit tests + slices
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ studies/       # Studies-related components + unit tests
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/               # Playwright E2E tests
â”œâ”€â”€ store/             # Redux Toolkit  store
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/             # Custom React hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ types/             # TypeScript types
â””â”€â”€ App.tsx            # Root component
```

## âœ¨ Technical Decisions

Redux Toolkit - used for predictable and scalable cart state management.

React Query - handles server state, API requests, and caching.

Tailwind CSS - provides utility-first styling.

Vitest + Testing Library - ensure React components are unit tested.

Playwright - covers full end-to-end user flows.

json-server - simulates a backend for local development.
